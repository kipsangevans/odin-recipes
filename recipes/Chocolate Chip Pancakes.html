    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There is something about these chocolate chip pancakes that just reminds you of childhood. It’s an easy, gooey meal that can be topped with whatever you like. When served warm, the chocolate chips melt in your mouth. 
        This recipe for chocolate chip pancakes is pretty straight-forward. The recipe includes milk and white vinegar, which you combine at the beginning to sour the milk, creating something similar to buttermilk. </p>
        <br>
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <br>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <br>
        <li>  ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <br>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <br>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <br>
        <li>½ cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <br>
        <li> cooking spray</li>
        <br>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><b>Steps</b></h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to sour the milk.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
